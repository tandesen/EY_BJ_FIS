I highly recommend [this course](https://eylearning.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/5733426?start=0#overview) to learn `pandas` package and machine learning algorithms and many others. By completing first 7 sections of this course, you should be confident using python `pandas` package to deal with Excel files. This course is on Udemy and you need to pay for it if you are not an EYer. There are other python packages designed for modifying Excel files such as `openpyxl`, which is more powerful than `pandas` when dealing with format issues[\[1\]](#references).
