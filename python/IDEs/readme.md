README
==================
Known IDEs are `pycharm`,`vscode`,`jupyter notebook`,`spyder`,`sublime`. I personally prefer `pycharm`.
`spyder` and `jupyter notebook` are installed by default if you download anaconda, which is recommanded for 
python beginners. I'll introduce IDEs mentioned above as far as I know.
