README
===========================
Except for machine learning algorithms introduced in another folder, there are some other algorithms which may help our work. I will introduce the `association rule` and `apriori algorithm` in this file. As I learn more, some other algorithms might be added in this file.

## Introduction
The best known anecdote about the association rule is probably the [Beer and Diapers Story](https://jborden.com/2018/12/07/beer-and-diapers-the-perfect-couple/). Wal-Mart used data mining to discover that young American males who bought diapers (nappies) also had a predisposition to buy beer. They moved the beer display closer to the diaper display and increased revenue.  
Suppose that our data contains customers and goods they purchase which is illustrated as following:

When it comes to the association rule with two items A and B, the first thing shows up in one's mind might be calculating the times A and B occur divide the times B occur. But that way the result might be effected by the popularity of B. I.e., if B is a very popular item like towel such that almost everyone would buy it, then we may have that every item is associated with towel. For that reason we introduce the [following definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning#Definition):
